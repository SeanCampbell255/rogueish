2D roguelike

Feature ideas
	-More UI
		+HP bar
			=use progress bar to visually show %
			=overlay it with numeric i.e. (65/100)
				_reference WoW or something
		+Show gold
		+XP progress bar
		+Eventually arrows to point of interest
	-GAMBA, like really though people love the gamba
		+rng mechanics can give that feel, like seeing the range an affix could roll in poe so you know you got lucky
	-pause
DONE		+BASE FUNCTIONALITY
		+ideally includes stats when available
		+stats must always be accurate at all times; HATE it when stats are never right in games like poe
	-xp
DONE		+on kill/event instead of pickup
		+algorithm to increase xp required to level
		+upon leveling up gain choice of skill or similar powerup
		+leaning on composition, resources and abstraction will help keep from repeating work
	-gold shop
		+post-death permanent upgrades
		+similar to above but persistant
	-saves
		+big for the gold shot
		+save statistics
		+locked/unlocked level-up upgrades and gold upgrades
	-enemy waves
		+some system for enemies to intensify, becomes stronger and more numerous
		+more xp, hp, dmg, etc
	-mirror image
		+rare pickup that creates a duplicate of player so they double attacks
	-weapons
		+create different kinds of attacks
		+can make as components, allowing them to be used by enemies
	-attributes
		+being able to have an "addded proj" that affects all weapons
	-extend pickups
		+xp garunteed, gold roll table, other pickup roll table (rogue genesia)
	-new enemies
		+keep individual enemy attributes minimal so they can just be handled globally
			=i.e. global defense mod instead of needing to set every independently
			=multipliers and attribs may work too
	-elites
		+tankier, hit harder, visually distinct, better drops
		+can have some unique attacks as a component, apply one at random to each elite
			=this would mean player could use them too, global weapons?
	-scripted bosses and spawns
		+just think about halls of torment, some objectives to keep interest and garuntee a path to power
	-equipment
	
NOTERS
	-even the shrimple stuff like "proximity damage hitbox" can be made into a component
		+this allows me to make a "thorns" skill or something where player has that hitbox, or a weapon that utilizes it
	-make an aesthetic that leans into my own aesthetic preferences and humor
		+i wanna feel motivated to make flavor text and dialogue or whatever because it's fun; that seems to come through on great games
