2D roguelike

Feature ideas
	-GAMBA, like really though people love the gamba
		+rng mechanics can give that feel, like seeing the range an affix could roll in poe so you know you got lucky
	-pause, options, etc
		+ideally includes stats 
		+stats must always be accurate at all times; HATE it when stats are never right in games like poe
	-xp pickups
		+upon leveling up gain choice of skill or similar powerup
		+leaning on composition, resources and abstraction will help keep from repeating work
	-gold shop
		+post-death permanent upgrades
		+similar to above but persistant
	-saves
		+big for the gold shot
		+save statistics
		+locked/unlocked level-up upgrades and gold upgrades
	-enemy waves
		+some system for enemies to intensify, becomes stronger and more numerous
	-mirror image
		+rare pickup that creates a duplicate of player so they double attacks
	-weapons
		+create different kinds of attacks
	-attributes
		+being able to have an "addded proj" that affects all weapons
	-extend pickups
		+xp garunteed, gold roll table, other pickup roll table (rogue genesia)
	-new enemies
		+keep individual enemy attributes minimal so they can just be handled globally
			=i.e. global defense mod instead of needing to set every independently
			=multipliers and attribs may work too
	-elites
		+tankier, hit harder, visually distinct, better drops
	-scripted bosses and spawns
		+just think about halls of torment, some objectives to keep interest and garuntee a path to power
	-equipment
